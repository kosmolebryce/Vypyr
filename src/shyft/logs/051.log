> 	Hello Veronica,

> 	Thanks for emailing me to remind me. However, I actually paid both of the last installments I had due last month, since I’d gotten a raise at work.

> 	I think it was Nathan who told me it was alright to pay both, and also approved the payments. I think it should be down on your system. I also received a confirmation email with the receipt, so if you need me to I can forward that to you as proof of my payment.

> 	They may have just forgot to change my request for reminder emails, since I signed up for them when I first bought the holiday.

#### 	JUSTIFICATION


	**Response A**

	While Response A fully delivers on the task at hand, it also features a less-than-“Amazing” amount of ambiguity — even for a summary. In particular, the phrasing of the second bullet point should be revised to enhance its clarity. For example, the phrase “both of the last installments he had due last month” is liable to be misinterpreted, since it could plausibly mean two distinct things. When interpreted as intended, it refers to the final two installments of Fred’s payment plan, which, According to Fred, were paid last month. On the other hand, one might erroneously surmise that “the last installments he had due last month” refers to not to the final two installments of the payment plan but, rather, to the *most recent* installments, both having been due and paid last month.

	**Response B**

	Summary B did not receive an “Amazing” rating for my overall impression because it is unclear and misleading: In its summary of the first email (from Veronica), the model fails to specify the final BNPL payment’s due date, instead mentioning only the month of the holiday itself. Especially when summarizing time-sensitive information, the model should prefer more precise langage, for example, by using “final” or “most recent” in lieu of “last,” which bears multiple meanings.

	Summary B’s issues do not stop with its syntax, though, for its claim that “Fred…asks Veronica to update their system” is hallucinatory. Fred merely suggests, “They may have just forgot to change my request for reminder emails…”

	**Annotation**

	In Response A, the model satisfactorily summarizes the essential information presented in both emails provided alongside the prompt. Although it could use some clarification, the main details of its message are comprehensible. Response B, on the other hand, suffers from a lack of specificity, ambiguating the main intents of both messages.
