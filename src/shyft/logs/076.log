## ANNOTATION

	> ### Response A

		* > Response A is *inaccurate*.
			* > Response A is inaccurate because it misstates the title of "Rio" by Bebel Gilberto. Additionally, the "Depth of My Soul by Thievery Corporation" hyperlink does not point to "Depth of My Soul." Instead, it links to "Saudade," which is the song referenced in the user-provided screenshot.

----

	> ### Response B

		* > Response B is *inaccurate*.
			* > Response B is inaccurate because, twice, it misstates the title of “A Brazilian Love Affair” by George Duke.

	> ### Overall Comparison

		* > Both responses are inaccurate. Even if they weren’t, though, they are quite similar: Each introduces its list of suggestions, provides five recommendations, and then concludes by describing the similarities between its recommendations and the song referenced in the user-provided screenshot. They are, therefore, of highly comparable quality.
